Starting out as a MCT student can be a pretty overwhelmning experience, meaning that you are required to use several new softwares and online environments from the very start to be able to follow the course materials. None of these tools are particulary difficult to use but its highly recommended (from experience!) that you get familiar with as many of them as possible before semester start.

In the spirit of this, we have made step-by-step instructions, video tutorials, general tips and other valuable information on a range of topics designed to help new students best prepare for the MCT masters program.

Topics:
* [How to prepare for the MCT masters program](https://github.com/MCT-master/Guides/wiki/How-to-prepare-for-the-MCT-masters-program)
* [Get the required MCT softwares](https://github.com/MCT-master/Guides/wiki/Required-MCT-software)
