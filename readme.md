Starting as an MCT student can be a pretty overwhelming experience, meaning that you are required to use several new software tools and online environments to be able to follow the course materials. Additionally, since you will be a student at both UiO and NTNU, the course registration process is a little more complex than usual. In light of this, we have provided you with step-by-step instructions, video tutorials, general tips and other valuable information on a range of topics designed to help you best prepare for the [MCT masters program](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/mct-master/).

From experience, I highly recommend that you go through each topic and do the necessary preparatory work before the semester starts.

* [How to prepare for the MCT masters program](https://github.com/MCT-master/Guides/wiki/How-to-prepare-for-the-MCT-masters-program)
