# MCT student guides

![mct-banner](assets/img/mct-banner.png)

Starting as an MCT student can be an overwhelming experience, meaning that you are required to use several new software tools and online environments from the start to be able to follow the course materials. Additionally, since you will be a student at both UiO and NTNU, the course registration process can be more confusing than usual. 

In light of this, we have made a guide featuring step-by-step instructions, video tutorials, general tips and other valuable information on a range of topics designed to make the [MCT](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/mct-master/) experience as smooth as possible. We therefore recommend all new students to go through each topic and do the necessary preparatory work before the semester starts.

Topics:
* [How to prepare for the MCT masters program](https://github.com/MCT-master/Guides/wiki/How-to-prepare-for-the-MCT-masters-program)
* [The softwares you need](https://github.com/MCT-master/Guides/wiki/The-softwares-you-need)
* [How to use the MCT Blog](https://github.com/MCT-master/Guides/wiki/How-to-use-the-MCT-Blog)
* [How to register for MCT courses](https://github.com/MCT-master/Guides/wiki/How-to-register-for-MCT-courses)
* [How to make Canvas your friend](https://github.com/MCT-master/Guides/wiki/Setting-up-Canvas)
