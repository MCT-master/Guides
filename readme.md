Starting out as an MCT student can be a pretty overwhelming experience, meaning that you are required to use several new software tools and online environments from the very start to be able to follow the course materials. Additionally, since you will be a student at both UiO and NTNU, the registration processes is a little more complex than usual. In light of this, we have provided you with step-by-step instructions, video tutorials, general tips and other valuable information on a range of topics designed to help you best prepare for the MCT masters program.

From experience, I highly recommend that you go through each topic and do the necessary preperatory work before the semester starts.
